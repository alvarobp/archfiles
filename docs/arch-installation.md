# Arch Installation

How to install Arch, with specifics for machines with one or more existing OSes.

## Create live USB

Flash an USB drive with the Arch installation image. I did it from GNOME, following https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium#Using_GNOME_Disk_Utility

## TMUX plugins

```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/bin/install_plugins
```
